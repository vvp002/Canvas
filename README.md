# Project 7 - Canvas

Canvas is an interactive canvas app where users can interact with a tray of emojis and
play around with them on the screen.

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can add and configure view elements
- [x] The user can drag the tray around the screen
- [x] Have different tray behaviors
- [x] User can create faces and pan them on the canvas

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Scale the faces every time there is gesture recognized to either scale up or down
- [] The arrow in the tray should rotate when the tray travels between the open and closed positions.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!


Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):
